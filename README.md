# [Assignment 3: OpenMP](https://www.raum-brothers.eu/martin/Chalmers_TMA881_1920/assignments.html#openmp)
> In this assignment, we count distances between points in 3-dimensional space. One possibility to think of this is as cells, whose coordinates were obtained by diagnostics and which require further processing.

> Distances are symmetric, i.e. distance between two cells c\_1 and c\_2 and the distance in reverse direction c\_2 to c\_1 should be counted once.
